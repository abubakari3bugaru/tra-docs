## EFDMS ENDPOINTS

1. Registration

It is a onetime request. Taxpayer must send TIN to TRA in order to generate VFD number.
Registration can be sent any time again in future in case VFD needs to retrieve original
registration data and server will resend the same information that were sent in first attempt.

2. Token

Token is a string of characters used as a second means of securing the API apart from
the PKI. After registering VFD must send request to get token data and use the token in
every request submitted. Token response will contain expiry time therefore billing VFD will
only request new token when existing one has expired.

3. Receipt/Invoice

Upon generation of receipt or invoice, VFD must submit respective receipt or invoice to
TRA. Before submitting information VD must check existing token if valid otherwise
request new token.

4. Z report

After close of business, VFD must submit Z report, which is a summary of sales for the
day. VFD should submit Z report before opening sales of a new day.

5. Verification

All receipts or invoices printed must be associated with verification information i.e. QR
code, verification code. VFD must be able to generate verification information

## INTEGRATION PARAMETERS

- Client = webapi
- Certkey - TRA will provide during integration
- Cert-serial - Open certificate file and look for serial number
- TIN- Taxpayer identification number for the seller
- QR format: [https://virtual.tra.go.tz/efdmsRctVerify/RCTVNUM](https://virtual.tra.go.tz/efdmsRctVerify/RCTVNUM)
- QR - Taxpayer system will generate QR and not TRA

## API INTEGRATION RULES

1. Registration is a onetime request. In order to be able to access `EFDMS` taxpayer (seller) must send TIN number so TRA can register VFD for use

2. Registration data must be saved to taxpayer system database for later use.

3. When successful registered VFD will not be required to send registration again when submitting receipts/invoices.

4. TIN belongs to the seller and not the customer (buyer). There is a parameter for customer i.e. `CUSTID`

5. Cert-Serial is a serial number of certificate file (pfx) used to sign request where private key will be used in this case. (TRA provides)

6. `GC, RCTNUM` and Dc must be maintained by taxpayer's system

7. GC must always be equal to `RCNUM` and starts from one (1) and always increment for each invoice/receipt issued. Numbers should follow sequence without skipping

8. DC starts with 1 and increment until 23:59:59 (midnight) and after midnight DC resets (starts with 1 again when first invoice/receipt for a new day is issued)

9. Different receipts/invoices can never have same GC they must always be unique

10. Different receipts/invoices can never have same `RCTNUM` they must always be unique

11. Different receipts/invoices issued in same day can never have same DC

12. `ZNUM` must always be same as `RCT_DATE` but in a number format i.e. YYYYMMDD

13. Previous receipt/invoice must never have latest `ZNUM`, `RCT_DATE` than the current receipt/invoice.

14. Future dates are not allowed, therefore when VFD generates receipt/invoice it must take current timestamp

15. If transaction is cancelled, next transaction should take not reuse transaction of cancelled transaction it should take new number in the sequence

16. Token will be requested only after expiry of current one, so before posting to TRA check if current token is valid and only post if is valid otherwise request new one

17. Token value must be saved to taxpayer system database

18. If for some reason if receipt is issued with wrong data but received success response, when sending again with correct data assign a new receipt number don’t reuse same if
    you send same receipt the later will be treated as duplicate and wont saved because `rctvnum` is same.

19. If `CUSTIDTYPE=1` i.e. TIN is chosen, we recommend to restrict input to only 9 digits meaning only numbers should be allowed because TIN is always a 9 digits number. `CUSTIDTYPES` for other IDs can remain open as string.

20. `MOBILENUM` should not contain `+` or spaces or dashes, it should in the format `255712XXXXXX` or `0712XXXXXX`

21. If VFD get success response it should not resubmit same transaction again.

22. If for any reason VFD does not receive response at all or receiving negative response (`ACKCODE` which is not 0) for specific invoice/receipt then when resubmitting the same invoice/receipt to TRA the VFD should submit the original xml content and not the modified the content this include also `ZNUM` and `RCT_DATE`, `RCT_TIME` must always be date of the first attempt and not the current date/time. This is to say monitor status of each receipt
    and only when response with `ACKCODE 0` returned consider receipt successful delivered to TRA

23. Print/send receipt/invoice to customer (do not wait for TRA response) and immediately send receipt to TRA (1 and 2 can either be concurrent or 2 can follow after 1).

24. For a specific receipt if no response is received VFD should keep try sending same request until it receives response.

25. Send one transaction at a time (asynchronous) only send next transaction when current one has succeeded

26. For printed receipts/invoices, taxpayer must display verification information (QR and code) on the printout.

27. To avoid receipt/invoices being rejected ,escape special characters in receipt/invoice XML especially in customer name or items descriptions.

28. When TRA server is not accessible (OFFLINE), continue generating transactions as they occur but make sure you design a mechanism to save status of each transaction i.e. success or pending while keep checking for connection and later when TRA connection resumes automatically resend all pending transactions in the order.

29. Token will be requested only after expiry of current one, so before posting to TRA check if current token is valid and only post if is valid otherwise request new one

30. Token value must be saved to taxpayer system database

## 2.7.2. Token Request

EFDMS uses Tokens for message exchange between EFDMS and Tax Payer Billing System. All request that will be send to the server must be accompanied with valid token in the message header, which will be validated by the server and if the token is valid, then the billing system will able to access and post the transaction.

A token is a piece of data that has no meaning or use on its own, but combined with the correct tokenization system, becomes a vital player in securing the Web API. Token-based authentication works by ensuring that each request to the server is send together with a signed token, which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the request. Token will be provide in seconds therefore taxpayer billing systems should be programmed in a way to only request new token when current one expires.

Token generated will have lifetime in seconds; the taxpayer billing system should always save token time and check the time now against the token time before posting the receipt/invoice. If the token time has expired, that is when taxpayer-billing system requests a new one. This mechanism helps taxpayer-billing systems to operate fast as opposed to requesting new token every time when posting receipt invoice since it involves adding claims to each token that would end up slowing the process.

### Digital Signature Security

Signature generation:

1. Registration
   To get signature use private key provided to sign body section `<REGDATA></REGDATA>` using SHA1 algorithm with RSA

2. Receipt posting
   To get signature use private key provided to sign body section `<RCT></RCT>` using SHA1 algorithm with RSA

3. Z Report posting
   To get signature use private key provided to sign body section `<ZREPORT></ZREPORT>` using SHA 1 algorithm with RSA
